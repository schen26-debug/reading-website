        <h1 class="box2">Reading Response #1: Laurel Schwulst</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="box">Laurel Schwulst says that websites can be considered not only technical constructs but 
            also spaces of creation that reflect the creator. The part of the reading that I liked 
            most is when Laurel Schwulst describes the different ways that a website can function as. 
            The author uses many metaphors that show so many varieties of how a website can be. It can be 
            a website as a room, which contains many content, a website as a shelf, which contains many conceptual 
            and creative ideas, a website as a plant, which grows slowly in time, a website as a garden, which 
            develop and change over seasons, a website as a puddle, which is more temporary, or a website as a rock 
            thrown into the ocean, which is made once and then left alone.These metaphors help me realize that a 
            personal website does not need to be perfect and complete. It is a living space that reflects one’s 
            identity, personality, and changes. I feel like this essay really helps artists like me to create their 
            own websites on the internet.</p>
