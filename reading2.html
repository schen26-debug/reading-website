        <h1>Reading Response #2: J. R. Carpenter</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The “handmade web” dates back to the period when people made their websites manually, without using much 
            technology or requiring much human effort. Websites at that point in time are very simple, and always under 
            construction, or in other words, temporarily made. These sites are more like individual artist’s websites 
            rather than complex designed modern sites. As described by J.R. Carpenter, the early websites disobeyed the 
            concepts of design, authorship, identity, and work itself. The process of coding the sites turned passive viewers 
            to active participants. Researchers, such as Olia Lialina, say that the mid 1990s web was colorful, personal, and 
            always under construction. However, as time passes, the do-it-yourself ethos gradually disappears with the appearance 
            of the commercial web.The DIY web is also important to me because it shows what the web used to be able to accommodate,
             for example, aspects like slowness, individualism, and experimentation. It tells us that we can control our 
             own creative path.</p>
