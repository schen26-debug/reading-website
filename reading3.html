         <h1>Reading Response #3: Taeyyon Choi</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>In Handmade Computer, Taeyyon Choi analyses the computer from a new perspective. Taeyyon Choi does not concentrate 
            on the smoothness and completeness of the computer body. He analyses the computer from the perspective of an anthropologist 
            and artist. Taeyyon Choi emphasizes that the computer is not just an invention of technology, but is also influenced by 
            history, power, and humans. Through the process of Taeyyon Choi making the computer ‘by hand’, he is able to connect and 
            link technology and humanity together. One of the concepts in the reading is really interesting to me. Choi describes that 
            life does not exist in binary logic. This concept is described to us by using the concept of dawn and dusk. Both dawn and 
            dusk lie somewhere in between two stages. They do not belong to either category. However, computer systems rely on clear rules 
            and fixed logic. This is very important, because of this aspect, computers find it difficult to simulate these stages. 
            This reading helps me see computers not just as tools, but as designed systems that reflect the human world.</p>
