        <h1>Reading Response #1: Laurel Schwulst</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Laurel Schwulst says that websites can be considered not only technical constructs but 
            also spaces of creation that reflect the creator. The part of the reading that I liked 
            most is when Laurel Schwulst describes the different ways that a website can function as. 
            The author uses many metaphors that show so many varieties of how a website can be. It can be 
            a website as a room, which contains many content, a website as a shelf, which contains many conceptual 
            and creative ideas, a website as a plant, which grows slowly in time, a website as a garden, which 
            develop and change over seasons, a website as a puddle, which is more temporary, or a website as a rock 
            thrown into the ocean, which is made once and then left alone.These metaphors help me realize that a 
            personal website does not need to be perfect and complete. It is a living space that reflects one’s 
            identity, personality, and changes. I feel like this essay really helps artists like me to create their 
            own websites on the internet.</p>


        <h1>Reading Response #2: J. R. Carpenter</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The “handmade web” dates back to the period when people made their websites manually, without using much 
            technology or requiring much human effort. Websites at that point in time are very simple, and always under 
            construction, or in other words, temporarily made. These sites are more like individual artist’s websites 
            rather than complex designed modern sites. As described by J.R. Carpenter, the early websites disobeyed the 
            concepts of design, authorship, identity, and work itself. The process of coding the sites turned passive viewers 
            to active participants. Researchers, such as Olia Lialina, say that the mid 1990s web was colorful, personal, and 
            always under construction. However, as time passes, the do-it-yourself ethos gradually disappears with the appearance 
            of the commercial web.The DIY web is also important to me because it shows what the web used to be able to accommodate,
             for example, aspects like slowness, individualism, and experimentation. It tells us that we can control our 
             own creative path.</p>

        
         <h1>Reading Response #1: Taeyyon Choi</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>In Handmade Computer, Taeyyon Choi analyses the computer from a new perspective. Taeyyon Choi does not concentrate 
            on the smoothness and completeness of the computer body. He analyses the computer from the perspective of an anthropologist 
            and artist. Taeyyon Choi emphasizes that the computer is not just an invention of technology, but is also influenced by 
            history, power, and humans. Through the process of Taeyyon Choi making the computer ‘by hand’, he is able to connect and 
            link technology and humanity together. One of the concepts in the reading is really interesting to me. Choi describes that 
            life does not exist in binary logic. This concept is described to us by using the concept of dawn and dusk. Both dawn and 
            dusk lie somewhere in between two stages. They do not belong to either category. However, computer systems rely on clear rules 
            and fixed logic. This is very important, because of this aspect, computers find it difficult to simulate these stages. 
            This reading helps me see computers not just as tools, but as designed systems that reflect the human world.</p>
