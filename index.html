        <h1>Reading Response #1: Laurel Schwulst</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Laurel Schwulst says that websites can be considered not only technical constructs but also spaces of creation that reflect the creator. The part of the reading that I liked most is when Laurel Schwulst describes the different ways that a website can function as. The author uses many metaphors that show so many varieties of how a website can be. It can be a website as a room, which contains many content, a website as a shelf, which contains many conceptual and creative ideas, a website as a plant, which grows slowly in time, a website as a garden, which develop and change over seasons, a website as a puddle, which is more temporary, or a website as a rock thrown into the ocean, which is made once and then left alone. 

These metaphors help me realize that a personal website does not need to be perfect and complete. It is a living space that reflects one’s identity, personality, and changes. I feel like this essay really helps artists like me to create their own websites on the internet.</p>
        <h1>Reading Response #2: J. R. Carpenter</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The “handmade web” dates back to the period when people made their websites manually, without using much technology or requiring much human effort. Websites at that point in time are very simple, and always under construction, or in other words, temporarily made. These sites are more like individual artist’s websites rather than complex designed modern sites. As described by J.R. Carpenter, the early websites disobeyed the concepts of design, authorship, identity, and work itself. The process of coding the sites turned passive viewers to active participants. Researchers, such as Olia Lialina, say that the mid 1990s web was colorful, personal, and always under construction. However, as time passes, the do-it-yourself ethos gradually disappears with the appearance of the commercial web.

The DIY web is also important to me because it shows what the web used to be able to accommodate, for example, aspects like slowness, individualism, and experimentation. It tells us that we can control our own creative path.</p>
